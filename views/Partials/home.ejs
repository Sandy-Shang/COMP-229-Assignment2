    <h4>My mission statement:</h4>
<p><em>“Out, out, brief candle!<br>
    Life’s but a walking shadow, 
    A poor player <br>
    that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, <br>and then is heard no more: 
    It is a tale <br>told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, <br>signifying nothing.”</p>
    
</em><p>-Macbeth, Act 5, Scene 5</p>
